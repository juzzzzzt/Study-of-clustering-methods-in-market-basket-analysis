Term Paper by Ivan Churilov

üìÅ Repository Description
This repository contains data files and the main codebase for processing intermediate results and generating final summary tables as part of a data analysis project. The project focuses on clustering, association rules, and customer segmentation using various metrics.

These .xlsx files are generated at different stages of the analysis pipeline and serve as inputs or outputs for further processing.  
project.ipynb ‚Äî The core Jupyter Notebook of the project. It includes the full logic for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, association rule mining, and result generation. This notebook is the primary entry point for running the analysis.  
  
üí° Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to maintain all versions of the data throughout the processing pipeline and ensure full reproducibility of the analytical workflow through a single notebook file (project.ipynb). The project aims to explore customer segmentation using clustering techniques (e.g., K-means, EM), analyze association rules, and generate detailed matrices for further insights.
